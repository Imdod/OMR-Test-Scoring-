Digital image processing based OMR (test scoring) using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.
In this work the Optical Mark Recognition is based on special exam sheets that I have desingned.
Optical paper consists of Student Number, Answer Form, Student Information, Signature, Booklet Type sections and key points.
Firstly, thresholds techniques are applied to the images coming from the scanner as imput to the system.
Morphological Operations are applayed.
After turning the images to binary images and applying morphological operations, key points are detected. With the help of key points, the degree of skewness of the image that are skew is determined and restored as a normal rectangle by trasforming.
Student Number, Answers, Booklet Type of each student will be detected the answers will be comprised with Answer Keys.
